3D isometric view of integrated pressure network model developed in Autodesk Civil 3D for a large-scale Data Center site. The model includes main trunk lines, branch connections and fire protection assemblies coordinated with the proposed grading surface. Elevations were controlled dynamically to maintain hydraulic continuity and constructability compliance.

Plan view construction sheet extracted directly from the Civil 3D model, displaying pipe sizes, fittings, hydrant assemblies, elevations and deflection angles. All annotations are dynamically linked to the pressure network model, enabling revision-controlled updates during design iterations.

Coordinated proposed surface and pressure network model showing vertical integration between grading design and underground utilities. Pipe invert levels were referenced against the grading surface to ensure slope consistency and clash-free installation across the site footprint.

### 2. Mountain Access Road – Lake County, California (USA)

Client: SANDIS Engineering
Scope: Corridor modelling and grading optimization under mountainous terrain constraints.

This project involved full roadway alignment development, profile design and corridor modelling integrated with existing topography. The design required continuous revision management and dynamic labeling updates as drainage and grading conditions evolved.

#### Technical Highlights:
- Corridor model required continuous adjustment due to drainage-driven grading modifications.
- Alignment creation and profile optimization
- Corridor modelling with custom assemblies
- Cut/Fill analysis and grading integration
- Dynamic labeling linked to design modifications
- Sheet production and layout management
- Structured Data Shortcuts environment
- Plan and Profile Documentation (Plan and profile views generated directly from Civil 3D corridor model, including existing vs proposed ground comparison and longitudinal slope control).
- Sheet Set Organization

Plan and profile view of mountain access road developed using Civil 3D corridor modelling. The drawing illustrates horizontal alignment, vertical geometry, cut/fill transitions and comparison between existing and proposed ground at centerline. Slopes were optimized to meet design constraints under steep topographic conditions.

### 3. GDCD BU1045 – Site Grading Reconstruction (As-Built Based)

Scope: Reconstruction of full site grading model based on as-built survey points delivered by contractor.

The project required rebuilding the grading surface to match field-verified elevations while ensuring constructability and alignment with civil utilities.

#### Technical Highlights:
- Surface reconstruction from survey point cloud data
- Grading redefinition based on verified field elevations
- Platform balancing and slope validation
- Integration with multidisciplinary models in Navisworks
- QA/QC validation against as-built control points
- Navisworks integrated model view showing reconstructed grading platforms and site-wide surface control.
- Surface reconstruction required reconciliation between contractor survey data and design intent elevations.

Triangulated surface model reconstructed from as-built survey point data. The grading surface was regenerated to reflect verified field elevations, enabling slope validation, platform balancing and QA/QC comparison against contractor-delivered survey controls.

### Professional Approach: 

All projects presented were developed under consultancy environments requiring:

- Remote collaboration
- Strict QA/QC procedures
- Revision-controlled workflows
- Multidisciplinary coordination
- Constructability-focused modelling
- Models were structured to support design changes while maintaining geometric and hydraulic integrity.
